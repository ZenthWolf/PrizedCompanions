	<description>Prevents any named animals from being included for consideration by the autoslaughterer. Optionally, Prized Companions may be included in animal counts if desired- mind that you update your slaughter quotas!
	
Named animals can still be manually slaughtered for tough seasons and are still included in sales listings, but your prized animals and beloved pets will be spared from voracious butchers.
	
	===Save Game Compatability===
Prized Companions can be activated and deactivated midgame, however expect to need to update your autoslaughter numbers! Mod settings should take effect immediately without need to reload.
	
	===Mod Compatability===
Please let me know if conflicts arise. The mod should be highly compatible, but issues may arise with multiplayer mods- this is untested grounds.
